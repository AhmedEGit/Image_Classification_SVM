# Image classification with SVM (Support Vector Machine)

This project provides an SVM-based solution for classifying images into predefined categories. It's particularly useful for tasks such as image recognition where the goal is to categorize images into different classes. The model can be trained on datasets and provides functionality to save and load the trained models for future use.
